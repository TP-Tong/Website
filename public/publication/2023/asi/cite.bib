  abstract = {In addition to a physical comprehension of the world, humans possess a high social intelligenceâ€”the intelligence that senses social events, infers the goals and intents of others, and facilitates social interaction. Notably, humans are distinguished from their closest primate cousins by their social cognitive skills as opposed to their physical counterparts. We believe that artificial social intelligence (ASI) will play a crucial role in shaping the future of artificial intelligence (AI). This article begins with a review of ASI from a cognitive science standpoint, including social perception, theory of mind (ToM), and social interaction. Next, we examine the recently-emerged computational counterpart in the AI community. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion on topics related to ASI.}
