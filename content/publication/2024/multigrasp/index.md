abstract: The intricate kinematics of the human hand enable simultaneous grasping and manipulation of multiple objects, essential for tasks such as object transfer and in-hand manipulation. Despite its significance, the domain of robotic multi-object grasping is relatively unexplored and presents notable challenges in kinematics, dynamics, and object configurations. This paper introduces MultiGrasp, a novel two-stage approach for multi-object grasping using a dexterous multi-fingered robotic hand on a tabletop. The process consists of (i) generating pre-grasp proposals and (ii) executing the grasp and lifting the objects. Our experimental focus is primarily on dual-object grasping, achieving a success rate of 44.13%, highlighting adaptability to new object configurations and tolerance for imprecise grasps. Additionally, the framework demonstrates the potential for grasping more than two objects at the cost of inference speed.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We propose MultiGrasp, a two-stage framework for simultaneous multi-object grasping with multi-finger dexterous hands. In addition, we contribute Grasp'Em, a large-scale synthetic multi-object grasping dataset.
