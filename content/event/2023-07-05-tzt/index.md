title: "Improving Language Models' Reasoning: A Systematic Perspective"

event: TongZhi Talk
# event_url: https://example.org

location: Zoom Meeting

summary: TongZhi Talk series
abstract: This talk discuss how recipes for building LLMs of strong reasoning capability from first principles. We envisage large language models to become the next-generation computational platform and foster an ecosystem of LLM-based new applications. This naturally requires the foundation models to perform complex tasks that often involve the composition of linguistic and logical operations. We first review the generic recipe for building large language models. Then we discuss recipes for improving language models' reasoning capabilities and the corresponding evaluation. Finally, we consider further improvements by complexity-based prompting, distilling chain-of-thought, and learning from AI feedback.

### Speakers

Yao Fu is a Ph.D. student at University of Edinburgh. Previously he finished his M.S. in Columbia University and B.S. in Peking University. Yao studies large scale probabilistic generative models for human language. His research interests include complex reasoning, alignment-focused evaluation, and how to inject strong abilities to language models from first principles.
